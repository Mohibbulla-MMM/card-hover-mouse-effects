# Card Hover Cursor Effects

This project showcases a dynamic, interactive card with hover effects that change the background, mouse cursor, and button style. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create animated hover and cursor-tracking effects on the card.

## Features

- **Hover Cursor Effect**: The background changes based on cursor movement.
- **Animated Card Background**: The card background blurs and overlays on hover.
- **Interactive Button**: A button on the card with hover effects.
- **JavaScript Animations**: Custom animations triggered by JavaScript for interactive effects.
